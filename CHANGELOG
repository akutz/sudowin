----------
- Released Sudo for Windows version 0.3.2-r147

- Bugfix - Moderate - Corrects exception that gets thrown when any locale 
other than en-US invokes sudowin.  This exception was occuring because
there was a principal permission check for "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" in the
Plugins.CredentialsCache.LocalServer assembly in order to restrict 
security sensitive methods to the SYSTEM user.  The rub is of course that
the SYSTEM account is not spelled the same way in all languages.

This bug was discovered by Lourival Neto.  Thanks Lourival!

----------
- Released Sudo for Windows version 0.3.1-r143

- Bugfix - Minor - Corrects the problem where the console client would not 
accept a zero-length password

- Bugfix - Major - Corrects the problem where any account in the Sudoers 
group could create a remoting client and access the data source that stored 
encrypted credentials.  The credentials in question ARE encrypted, but a sudo 
user could still gain access to them.  This has now been restricted to the 
builtin account "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM".

- Changed the console client's prompt from "Please enter your passphrase: 
" to "Passphrase: ".

possible argument strings.

associate md5 checksums against configured executables to ensure the integrity 
of the file being sudoed.

- Gracefully handles errors in the callback application.

2006/06/25
----------
- Added allowAllCommands attribute to the default settings section in the 
XmlAuthorizationPlugin section.  This will create an insecure mode where all 
users can execute all commands.  This mode is not recommended and if used 
should only be used on stand-a-lone machines where users wish to practice LUA, 
but want easy sudo.
